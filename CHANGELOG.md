## [2.3.0] - 2026-09-24

The Audience Data Commons data model moves out of this repository into its own standard,
[NPA-AI-Co-Lab/adc-schema](https://github.com/NPA-AI-Co-Lab/adc-schema), published as
`@npa-ai-co-lab/adc-schema`. The CLI becomes a consumer of that package. No change to the
content of the data model.

### Added

- Dependency on `@npa-ai-co-lab/adc-schema` (^1.0.0); `npm install` brings the schema and the eight taxonomies into `node_modules/`
- Taxonomy resolver (`src/jsonld/taxonomy.ts`): the taxonomy directory is looked up in order — explicit path → installed `@npa-ai-co-lab/adc-schema` package → vendored fallback `vendor/taxonomies/`. An explicit path that does not exist is a configuration error and is never silently replaced; when nothing resolves, the error lists every location tried and why it was skipped
- Configuration option `taxonomiesPath` and CLI flag `--taxonomies <dir>` (validated as an existing directory; the flag overrides the config key)
- Run summary line `📚 Taxonomies: explicit|package|vendor (<dir>)` stating which source was actually used; the same is recorded in the output metadata entry (`taxonomiesSource`, `taxonomiesPath`)
- `vendor/taxonomies/` — pinned copy of the taxonomies from `@npa-ai-co-lab/adc-schema` for offline and air-gapped installs, marked read-only in `vendor/README.md`; `npm run vendor:check` (also a test) verifies it matches the installed package, `npm run vendor:sync` refreshes it after a dependency bump
- Tests: `tests/taxonomy-resolver.test.ts` (15) and `tests/taxonomies-config.test.ts` (11) — precedence, error listing, config/CLI surface, end-to-end rules-only run with an explicit directory, vendor parity. Suite grows from 207 to 233

### Changed

- Default `schemaPath` in `config.json`, `config/hackathon.config.json` and the `schema` reference in `config/sample_comments.rules.json` now point at the schema inside the installed package (`node_modules/@npa-ai-co-lab/adc-schema/schema/adc.schema.jsonld`) instead of `examples/schema.jsonld`
- `files` whitelist ships `vendor/` instead of `taxonomies/`
- `createConfigHash` includes `taxonomiesPath` only when it is set, so hashes of existing configs (and resume detection on existing databases) are unchanged
- A missing individual taxonomy file still yields an empty enum with a warning; the warning now names the taxonomy source in use
- README: new section "ADC schema and taxonomies"; `schemaPath`, `taxonomiesPath` and `--taxonomies` documented; project structure updated

### Removed

- `examples/schema.jsonld` and `taxonomies/*.json` — the data model is no longer hosted in this repository. The only taxonomy data left in the tree is the vendored fallback

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- OpenAI rate limit handling: SDK errors now surface to retry gate immediately; Retry-After headers are honoured with separate budget (default 6 retries, 90s max wait); output is finalized and resume hint printed on failure
- Single failed batch no longer aborts entire run; Promise.allSettled now captures summary of failures with exit code 1
- API key no longer required for rules-only runs; lazy LLM client creation
- Placeholder OpenAI key detection and warning
- CLI starts from any working directory: `./config.json` is no longer read at module load, and CLI-only invocations (`analyze -i … -s … -o …` without `-c`) fall back to built-in defaults when no `./config.json` exists (found by QA on a clean global install)
- Fallback model for validation retries now comes from the run's config (`fallbackModel` / `--fallback-model`) instead of whatever `./config.json` happened to be in the current directory
- 401/403 from the provider and configuration errors (e.g. missing key) abort the run immediately with one clear message instead of one failure per batch

### Added

- Rate-limit gate (`RateLimitGate`) with Retry-After awareness and separate budgeting
- Metered release after a rate-limit pause: waiting batches are let through one per Retry-After interval (spacing halves after every 3 consecutive successes) instead of all at once, so concurrent batches stop burning their retry budget on contention (QA: concurrency 10 vs 3 RPM previously failed 7 of 16 batches; now 0)
- `files` whitelist in `package.json` — the npm tarball ships only `dist`, `static`, `taxonomies`, `config`, `examples` and docs (203 → 95 files)
- Throttled LLM client with adaptive concurrency (halves after 2 consecutive 429s, ramps +1 after 20 clean successes)
- `src/clients/llm-errors.ts` with `LLMRequestError`, `normalizeLLMError`, and `parseRetryAfterMs`
- Hackathon configuration preset (`config/hackathon.config.json`) for new/low-tier OpenAI accounts
- CLI flags: `--rate-limit-retries`, `--rate-limit-max-wait`, `--sdk-retries`, `--no-adaptive-concurrency`, `--fail-fast`
- Configuration options: `rateLimitMaxRetries` (default 6), `rateLimitMaxWaitMs` (default 90000), `sdkMaxRetries` (default 0), `adaptiveConcurrency` (default true), `failFast` (default false)
- Logging enhancements: new error type `rate_limit_error`, action `retry_after_wait`, and field `waitMs`

### Changed

- `retriesNumber` config option now applies to validation/model errors only, not rate limits
- Fallback model is never used for 429/5xx responses
- `runWithRetries` rejects with original error instead of generic AbortError
- OpenAI SDK `maxRetries` defaults to 0 (intentional) so rate limits surface immediately to the gate
- `.gitignore` updated to track `output/.gitkeep` and ignore `node_modules` without trailing slash
- Test suite expanded from 117 to 200 passing tests
